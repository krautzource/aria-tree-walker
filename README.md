# mathjax-sre-walker

A lightweight walker for server-side generated [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax) rendering using enriched input via [speech rule engine](https://github.com/zorkow/speech-rule-engine/issues).

## History and prior art

The initial prototype was developed during the AIM workshop [Web accessibility of mathematics](https://aimath.org/pastworkshops/webmath.html). Much of this code is based on prior work in [MathJax](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax), [speech rule engine](https://github.com/zorkow/speech-rule-engine/issues), and [ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/) (part of [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)).
